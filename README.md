## Issue
```
The developer community is constantly evolving and it is essential that the resources offered to help 
stay current and improve skills are of high quality and relevant to the needs of this community. 
Our technical podcast website aims to provide quality content that meets the expectations of developers and 
will help them stay informed about the latest development trends and technologies.
To achieve this goal, we will need to implement a rigorous selection process for experts invited to record
a podcast and ensure that the content offered is up-to-date and covers topics relevant 
to the developer community.

## My proposed solution
```
To solve the problem of creating a quality technical podcast website for developers, 
our proposed solution is to implementa rigorous selection process for experts invited to record a podcast.
We will also ensure that the content offered is up-to-date and covers topics relevant to the developer community.
Finally, we will ensure that the audio quality and presentation of the podcasts are of good quality to provide a 
pleasant listening experience for our users.To implement this solution, we will develop an online delivery 
platform for podcasts, with a content management system that will allow us to easily select and add new podcasts.
We will also implement a rating and commenting system to allow users to give feedback on podcasts and help us 
select the best experts and topics most relevant to our users.
